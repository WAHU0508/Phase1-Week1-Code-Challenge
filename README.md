Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.


Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
|Monthly Taxable Pay | Rate of Tax (%)|
| --- | --- |
|Up to 24,000 | 10.0|
|32,334 - 500,000 | 30.0|
|500,001 - 800,000 | 32.5|
|Above 800,000| 35.0|

|Gross Pay (Ksh) |Deduction (Ksh) |Gross Pay (Ksh) |Deduction (Ksh)|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|Up to 5,999 | 150| 40,000 - 44,999 | 1,000 |
|6,000 - 7,999	| 300 | 45,000 - 49,999 | 1,100 |
|8,000 - 11,999	| 400 |	50,000 - 59,999 | 1,200 |
|12,000 - 14,999 | 500	| 60,000 - 69,999 | 1,300 |
|15,000 - 19,999 | 600	| 80,000 - 89,999 | 1,500 |
|25,000 - 29,999 | 850	| 90,000 - 99,999 | 1,600 |
|30,000 - 34,999 | 900	| 100,000 and above | 1,700 |
|35,000 - 39,999 | 950|
